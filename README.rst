What is this?
=============

This is just a repo to learn the Python Cmd library. I have a need to be able to
dynamically generate a command line utilites base on a module api. So this will
be an area to POC that out.

How do I run this?
==================

You need to install:

1. Python (I tested it with 2.7 cpython)

Next run the command:

::

    $ python mycmd.py
    (platform) help
    ... #see output
    (platform) help machine
    ... #see output
    (platform) processor
    (platform) quit
    $
